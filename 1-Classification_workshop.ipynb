    "## Introduction to Transformers Architecture\n",
    "Currently, the most popular models for Natural Language Processing use the Transformer Architecture. There are several libraries implementing this architecture. However, in the context of NLP Huggingface transformers are most commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the source code itself, this library contains a number of other elements. Among the most important of these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "[models](https://huggingface.co/models) - a huge and growing number of ready-made models that we can use to solve many problems in NLP (but also in speech recognition or image processing),\n",
    "[datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) - a very large catalogue of useful datasets that we can easily use to train our own NLP models (and other models).\n",

    "## Environment preparation - How to start with Google Colab\n",

    "Training NLP models requires access to hardware accelerators to accelerate the learning of neural networks. If our computer is not equipped with a GPU, we can use the Google Colab environment.\n",

    "In this environment, we can choose an accelerator from GPU and TPU. Let us check if we have access to an environment equipped with an NVidia accelerator by executing the following command:\n"

    "\n",
    "- using a ready-made model that performs a specific task, e.g. [sentiment analysis](https://huggingface.co/finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis) - a model of this kind does not need to be trained, it is enough to run it in order to obtain a classification result (this can be seen in the demo at the indicated link),\n",
    "- using a base model that is trained for a specific task; an example of such a model is the [HerBERT base](https://huggingface.co/allegro/herbert-base-cased), which was taught as a masked language model. To use it for a specific task, we need to select a 'classification head' for it and retrain it on our own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models of this kind are different, and can be loaded using a common interface, but it is best to use one of the specialised classes, tailored to the task at hand. We will start by loading the BERT base model - one of the most popular models, for English. We will use it to guess missing words in the text. We will use the `AutoModelForMaskedLM` call to do this.\n",

    "The final element of preparation, which is optional, is to attach your own Google Drive to the Colab environment. This makes it possible to save trained models, during the training process, to an \"external\" drive. If Google Colab leads to an interruption of the training process, the files that were successfully saved during the training will nevertheless not be lost. It will be possible to resume training already on a partially trained model.\n",

When indicating where to save data during a workout, indicate a path starting with `/content/gdrive`, but indicate some subdirectory within our drive space.

    "## Text tokenization\n",
    "Loading the model itself, however, is not enough to start using it. We must have a mechanism for converting text (a string of characters), into a sequence of tokens, belonging to a specific dictionary. During the training of the model, this dictionary is determined (selected algorithmically) before the actual training of the neural network. Although it is possible to extend it later (training on the training data, it also allows to obtain a representation of missing tokens), usually the dictionary in the form that was defined before the neural network training is used. Therefore, it is important to specify the correct dictionary for the tokeniser performing the text splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library has an `AutoTokenizer` class that accepts the model name, which allows the dictionary corresponding to the selected neural network model to be automatically loaded. However, it is important to remember that if you are using 2 models, each will most likely have a different dictionary, and therefore they must have their own instances of the `Tokenizer` class."
